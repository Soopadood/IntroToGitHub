# IntroToGitHub (title)

# Description
Version control allows changes to a software's code to be tracked and managed over time. This allows one to see and make changes for a file version and to revert a file to an earlier version.

The purpose of this repository is to help me learn how to use GitHub and its importance as applied to software projects, for example.
